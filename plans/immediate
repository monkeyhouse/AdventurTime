upload database scaffolding into seperate repo
update it to accomodate new expecattions,
especially for user tracking features / stats


mid term:
design home page
style and create marketing content for home page,
make a plan to make it polished
components: make the top stories of the week component cards



later:
create a discuss forum and figure out how to integrate the comment system with
a. reviews ( should be 1 thread per story)
b. editing ( should be 1 forum per story, multiple threads ?)

q: do we need in-ap communication? decide later, forum messaging may be good enough


very long term:
